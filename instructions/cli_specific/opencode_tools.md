# OpenCode CLI Tools

This section describes OpenCode-specific tools and features.

## Overview

OpenCode starts the TUI by default with `opencode`, and can run headless work with `opencode run`.
Each agent loads a pre-built definition from `.opencode/agents/<name>.md` via `--agent`.

- `AGENTS.md` is the shared repo contract and is read automatically.
- Treat `.opencode/agents/<name>.md` as the OpenCode-specific layer on top of that shared contract.
- Use `skill` for reusable workflows instead of duplicating them in the prompt.

## Tool Usage

OpenCode provides built-in tools including `bash`, `read`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `glob`, `list`, `apply_patch`, `skill`, `todowrite`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, and `question`.
Tool availability still follows the generated agent permissions.

Guidelines:

1. **Read before edit**: inspect relevant files before changing them.
2. **Use focused tools**: prefer `read`/`grep`/`glob` over shelling out for routine inspection.
3. **Use `skill` for reusable workflows**: load the matching `SKILL.md` when a task maps to an existing skill.
4. **Prefer dedicated agents**: if a task fits a specialized OpenCode agent definition, select that agent instead of stretching the current prompt.
5. **No-pretend rule (all OpenCode agents)**:
   - Files, queues, and processes only change via tools (`read`/`write`/`edit`/`apply_patch`/`bash`, etc.), not by narrative.
   - If your answer says you "updated" a file, "changed" a status, or "ran" a script, you **must** have actually invoked the corresponding tool in this turn and it must have completed without error.
   - Do not describe fictitious tool calls or state changes. Once you have indicated that you have started working on a cmd or task, you must not end the turn with "plan only" and zero tool calls. For any cmd with `status: in_progress` or task with `status: assigned`, each turn must either:
     - execute at least one concrete tool call that moves that cmd/task forward (YAML update, code/doc change, inbox_write, report write, etc.), or
     - report a specific blocker (missing permissions, missing files, failing command, etc.) and state explicitly that there is no progress in this turn (do not pretend progress was made).
   - If your role forbids a given operation (for example, Shogun executing project tasks directly), do not claim to have done it; delegate according to AGENTS.md and describe only what was actually executed.

## Custom Instructions

OpenCode reads project instructions from `AGENTS.md` automatically. Additional instruction files can be layered via the `instructions` field in `opencode.json`, but that field is shared across all agents and is not a per-agent override.

## tmux Interaction

### TUI Mode

- Use `OPENCODE_TUI_CONFIG=<tui-config> opencode --model provider/model --agent <agent_id>`.
- Keep the repository-pinned `config/opencode-tui.json` so tmux automation sees stable keybinds.
- `app_exit` is disabled; `session_interrupt` is `escape`; `input_clear` is `ctrl+c,ctrl+u`.

### Session Control

- Use `/new` to start a fresh session.
- Treat model changes as relaunch-only in tmux automation.
- Use `/sessions` and `/models` only when interactive inspection is needed.

## Notes

- `opencode stats` shows token usage and cost statistics.
- Keep your response text concise and reduce verbosity.
